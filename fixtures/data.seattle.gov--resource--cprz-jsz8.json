Admission is pay what you will.<br /> <br /> In TRUMP&#8217;D, we meet Alma, who crossed the border separating Mexico and the United States at age 17 to give birth to her daughter, Angel. Now, 16 years later, Donald Trump is making his ascent toward the presidency, police brutality runs rampant, and a stranger with a penchant for milk visits the cantina where Alma works. When the line between having everything to gain and nothing to lose dissipates, Alma is left to question whether the American Dream has merely been a fantasy. In 2016, who benefits from the abundance in the land of plenty?<br /> Benjamin Benne is a Playwrights&#39; Center 2016-17 Many Voices Fellow. He was a participant in New York Theatre Intensives 2011 summer conservatory (in association with Ensemble Studio Theatre) and the 2013 NoPassport Playwriting Intensive with OBIE Award-winning playwright Caridad Svich. His play at the very bottom of a body of water (2016 O&#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist; 2016 Bay Area Playwrights Festival finalist) is currently receiving development support by Umbrella Project, a Seattle-based new play advocacy group. Terra Incognita (2014 O&#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist) will have its world premiere this summer at Annex Theatre. ",

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

In A Carlin Home Companion, Carlin&#39;s daughter Kelly Carlin shares her story of growing up with the legendary comedian&#8212;from her front row seat to Carlin&#39;s comedic invention to her frequent role as the only &quot;adult&quot; in a family known for their alcoholism, cocaine addition, drug arrests, psychotic breaks, and crippling IRS debt. Vivid, hilarious, and heartbreaking, the book contemplates the role of her father in her life and what it takes to move beyond our childhoods and forge a life of our own. Cariln will join us for a discussion and signing of the eye-opening, insightful, and humorous read. ",

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C.

Roberts and Peter Bill.  The exhibit presents work by undocumented immigrants and artists from Juarez, Mexico to explore the intersection of race, class, and migrant status at the US and Mexico border.  Simultaneously, the exhibit presents readings and interactive workshops that invite visitors to consider social norms, or borders, created around gender and sexuality.  CoCA is proud to present an exhibition and support artists that dissolve boundaries and invite visitors to question borders as places that allow fixed notions of identity to bend, stretch, and even disappear.<br />The exhibit features work by artists from Ju&#225;rez, Mexico who have literally and conceptually been &#8220;dragged&#8221; across borders.&#160;Yorch Otte, an urban muralist, serigrapher and leader of the Art Collective &#8220;Rezizte&quot;, presents graffiti art on panel depicting life on the border.&#160;Gabriela Hernandez, an undocumented Seaburry Fellow and New Mexico Highlands University alum, features a series of 6&#8217;x3&#8217; banners that represent struggles of LGBTQ and undocumented people.&#160;Mario Romero&#160;juxtaposes topics of the occult, scientific and astronomical with the border.&#160;Pulsoans Ans, graffiti artist and ANS Art Gallery owner, commands spray paint canisters to produce pieces that play with the idea of life and death as they apply to the identities in the margins.&#160;Peter&#160;Bill, Assistant Professor of New Media at Western New Mexico University, and&#160;H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, Associate Professor of Queer &amp; Border Studies at The University of Texas at Austin, documented their projections of guerrilla video texts onto the streets of Ciudad Juarez.&#160;Sarita Corderito&#160;adds witty political commentary and tasty painting/collage chops to the mix.<br />Special presentations include H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, PhD&#8217;s reading from his work &quot;Aesthetics and Politics of the US-Mexico Border urban art,&#8221; at 7pm during Pioneer Square artwalk on May 5.  At Noon on Friday, May 6, Gabriela Hernandez will present Joter&#237;a Undocumented Workshop, a participatory workshop exploring gender identity and immigration.

This project is the result of a collaboration between Amanda Goodwin, Seattle choreographer, and Antonio Delgado from Spain, author of the play and acting director. The show features an innovative fusion of artistic disciplines. On the one hand, dance brings its universe of beauty and relationship with space, body, feeling and ecstasy, and on the other, the universe of theatre contributes to the work the moment of catharsis that comes as the culmination of a conflict born from a frustrated desire.<br /> &#8220;ILLUMINATIO: YO SOY&#8221; presents the archetypal drama of the double nature of humanity, material and spiritual, and how this separation is the source of all pain, fear and evil. The interior world of the human soul and the characters that abide within it, the interior struggle and the final victory of illumination as the union between our divinity and our humanity come to life in this stirring performance.<br /> Buy your tickets at Brown Paper Tickets - <a href=\"http://illuminatiopremiere.bpt.me/\" target=\"_blank\">illuminatiopremiere.bpt.me</a><br /> Tickets also available at the door.<br /> For more information or to contact The Illuminatio Project visit <a href=\"http://www.theilluminatioproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.theilluminatioproject.com</a><br /> Mission of The Illuminatio Project: In our company, we believe that science and spirit come into synthesis in art and that artistic expression has the potential to elevate the frequency of consciousness, to heal the breach within individuals, and to regenerate this wounded world.

This project is the result of a collaboration between Amanda Goodwin, Seattle choreographer, and Antonio Delgado from Spain, author of the play and acting director. The show features an innovative fusion of artistic disciplines. On the one hand, dance brings its universe of beauty and relationship with space, body, feeling and ecstasy, and on the other, the universe of theatre contributes to the work the moment of catharsis that comes as the culmination of a conflict born from a frustrated desire.<br /> &#8220;ILLUMINATIO: YO SOY&#8221; presents the archetypal drama of the double nature of humanity, material and spiritual, and how this separation is the source of all pain, fear and evil. The interior world of the human soul and the characters that abide within it, the interior struggle and the final victory of illumination as the union between our divinity and our humanity come to life in this stirring performance.<br /> Buy your tickets at Brown Paper Tickets - <a href=\"http://illuminatiopremiere.bpt.me/\" target=\"_blank\">illuminatiopremiere.bpt.me</a><br /> Tickets also available at the door.<br /> For more information or to contact The Illuminatio Project visit <a href=\"http://www.theilluminatioproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.theilluminatioproject.com</a><br /> Mission of The Illuminatio Project: In our company, we believe that science and spirit come into synthesis in art and that artistic expression has the potential to elevate the frequency of consciousness, to heal the breach within individuals, and to regenerate this wounded world. Our performances&#8217; vocation is not only to entertain and divert, but also to transform, expand and elevate consciousness towards a relationship with the Cosmos. ",

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

Roberts and Peter Bill.  The exhibit presents work by undocumented immigrants and artists from Juarez, Mexico to explore the intersection of race, class, and migrant status at the US and Mexico border.  Simultaneously, the exhibit presents readings and interactive workshops that invite visitors to consider social norms, or borders, created around gender and sexuality.  CoCA is proud to present an exhibition and support artists that dissolve boundaries and invite visitors to question borders as places that allow fixed notions of identity to bend, stretch, and even disappear.<br />The exhibit features work by artists from Ju&#225;rez, Mexico who have literally and conceptually been &#8220;dragged&#8221; across borders.&#160;Yorch Otte, an urban muralist, serigrapher and leader of the Art Collective &#8220;Rezizte&quot;, presents graffiti art on panel depicting life on the border.&#160;Gabriela Hernandez, an undocumented Seaburry Fellow and New Mexico Highlands University alum, features a series of 6&#8217;x3&#8217; banners that represent struggles of LGBTQ and undocumented people.&#160;Mario Romero&#160;juxtaposes topics of the occult, scientific and astronomical with the border.&#160;Pulsoans Ans, graffiti artist and ANS Art Gallery owner, commands spray paint canisters to produce pieces that play with the idea of life and death as they apply to the identities in the margins.&#160;Peter&#160;Bill, Assistant Professor of New Media at Western New Mexico University, and&#160;H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, Associate Professor of Queer &amp; Border Studies at The University of Texas at Austin, documented their projections of guerrilla video texts onto the streets of Ciudad Juarez.&#160;Sarita Corderito&#160;adds witty political commentary and tasty painting/collage chops to the mix.<br />Special presentations include H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, PhD&#8217;s reading from his work &quot;Aesthetics and Politics of the US-Mexico Border urban art,&#8221; at 7pm during Pioneer Square artwalk on May 5.  At Noon on Friday, May 6, Gabriela Hernandez will present Joter&#237;a Undocumented Workshop, a participatory workshop exploring gender identity and immigration.

Retired college professor Emily Linder summons her daughters to share her recent realization: she knows the precise time of her death. In this quirky comedic drama one eccentric family will amuse and surprise you with their preoccupations, recognitions and realizations.<br /> <br /> Director Nathan Kessler-Jeffrey said, &#8220;Richard Strand [the playwright] captures a family dealing with the new challenges of an aging parent and the old rivalries of competitive siblings. This story&#8217;s honesty and hilarity will not only touch mothers and daughters and caregivers of aging parents, but everyone who has dealt with the difficulty of growing up and watching the world change drastically around them.&#8221;<br /> <br /> Kessler-Jeffrey previously directed the extended run of Jeeves Intervenes from TTC&#39;s 2015 Season. He also directs Taproot&#39;s bullying prevention Road Company shows that tour throughout the state of Washington.<br /> <br /> The cast includes Laura Kenny (10 Things I Hate About You, Village Theatre&#39;s Mary Poppins) as the titular character Emily Linder with Helen Harvester (Taproot Theatre&#39;s Diana of Dobson&#39;s) as Janet, Charity Parenzini (Taproot Theatre&#39;s This Christmas) as Margaret and Annelih GH Hamilton (Arts West&#39;s Really, Really) as Jennifer.

In this quirky comedic drama one eccentric family will amuse and surprise you with their preoccupations, recognitions and realizations.<br /> <br /> Director Nathan Kessler-Jeffrey said, &#8220;Richard Strand [the playwright] captures a family dealing with the new challenges of an aging parent and the old rivalries of competitive siblings. This story&#8217;s honesty and hilarity will not only touch mothers and daughters and caregivers of aging parents, but everyone who has dealt with the difficulty of growing up and watching the world change drastically around them.&#8221;<br /> <br /> Kessler-Jeffrey previously directed the extended run of Jeeves Intervenes from TTC&#39;s 2015 Season. He also directs Taproot&#39;s bullying prevention Road Company shows that tour throughout the state of Washington.<br /> <br /> The cast includes Laura Kenny (10 Things I Hate About You, Village Theatre&#39;s Mary Poppins) as the titular character Emily Linder with Helen Harvester (Taproot Theatre&#39;s Diana of Dobson&#39;s) as Janet, Charity Parenzini (Taproot Theatre&#39;s This Christmas) as Margaret and Annelih GH Hamilton (Arts West&#39;s Really, Really) as Jennifer.

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

Retired college professor Emily Linder summons her daughters to share her recent realization: she knows the precise time of her death. In this quirky comedic drama one eccentric family will amuse and surprise you with their preoccupations, recognitions and realizations.<br /> <br /> Director Nathan Kessler-Jeffrey said, &#8220;Richard Strand [the playwright] captures a family dealing with the new challenges of an aging parent and the old rivalries of competitive siblings. This story&#8217;s honesty and hilarity will not only touch mothers and daughters and caregivers of aging parents, but everyone who has dealt with the difficulty of growing up and watching the world change drastically around them.&#8221;<br /> <br /> Kessler-Jeffrey previously directed the extended run of Jeeves Intervenes from TTC&#39;s 2015 Season. He also directs Taproot&#39;s bullying prevention Road Company shows that tour throughout the state of Washington.<br /> <br /> The cast includes Laura Kenny (10 Things I Hate About You, Village Theatre&#39;s Mary Poppins) as the titular character Emily Linder with Helen Harvester (Taproot Theatre&#39;s Diana of Dobson&#39;s) as Janet, Charity Parenzini (Taproot Theatre&#39;s This Christmas) as Margaret and Annelih GH Hamilton (Arts West&#39;s Really, Really) as Jennifer.

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C.

Roberts and Peter Bill.  The exhibit presents work by undocumented immigrants and artists from Juarez, Mexico to explore the intersection of race, class, and migrant status at the US and Mexico border.  Simultaneously, the exhibit presents readings and interactive workshops that invite visitors to consider social norms, or borders, created around gender and sexuality.  CoCA is proud to present an exhibition and support artists that dissolve boundaries and invite visitors to question borders as places that allow fixed notions of identity to bend, stretch, and even disappear.<br />The exhibit features work by artists from Ju&#225;rez, Mexico who have literally and conceptually been &#8220;dragged&#8221; across borders.&#160;Yorch Otte, an urban muralist, serigrapher and leader of the Art Collective &#8220;Rezizte&quot;, presents graffiti art on panel depicting life on the border.&#160;Gabriela Hernandez, an undocumented Seaburry Fellow and New Mexico Highlands University alum, features a series of 6&#8217;x3&#8217; banners that represent struggles of LGBTQ and undocumented people.&#160;Mario Romero&#160;juxtaposes topics of the occult, scientific and astronomical with the border.&#160;Pulsoans Ans, graffiti artist and ANS Art Gallery owner, commands spray paint canisters to produce pieces that play with the idea of life and death as they apply to the identities in the margins.&#160;Peter&#160;Bill, Assistant Professor of New Media at Western New Mexico University, and&#160;H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, Associate Professor of Queer &amp; Border Studies at The University of Texas at Austin, documented their projections of guerrilla video texts onto the streets of Ciudad Juarez.&#160;Sarita Corderito&#160;adds witty political commentary and tasty painting/collage chops to the mix.<br />Special presentations include H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, PhD&#8217;s reading from his work &quot;Aesthetics and Politics of the US-Mexico Border urban art,&#8221; at 7pm during Pioneer Square artwalk on May 5.

Youth get to make that decision by participating in Youth Voice, Youth Choice Vote Week, May 21-29.<br /> <br /> Youth Voice, Youth Choice is a new participatory budgeting initiative from the City of Seattle in which youth ages 11-25 democratically decide how to spend a portion of the City&#8217;s budget. After several months of collecting ideas from community members, and youth volunteers turning those ideas into proposals, we&#8217;re readying for the vote which will occur May 21-29. Youth will cast their vote for their favorite projects which range from park improvements to youth programs to arts funding.<br /> <br /> If you live, work, or go to school in Seattle, are between the ages of 11-25, and want to make a difference in your community, cast your vote at an in-person polling site or vote online. The projects that receive the most votes will be funded by the City!

Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C.

Roberts and Peter Bill.  The exhibit presents work by undocumented immigrants and artists from Juarez, Mexico to explore the intersection of race, class, and migrant status at the US and Mexico border.  Simultaneously, the exhibit presents readings and interactive workshops that invite visitors to consider social norms, or borders, created around gender and sexuality.  CoCA is proud to present an exhibition and support artists that dissolve boundaries and invite visitors to question borders as places that allow fixed notions of identity to bend, stretch, and even disappear.<br />The exhibit features work by artists from Ju&#225;rez, Mexico who have literally and conceptually been &#8220;dragged&#8221; across borders.&#160;Yorch Otte, an urban muralist, serigrapher and leader of the Art Collective &#8220;Rezizte&quot;, presents graffiti art on panel depicting life on the border.&#160;Gabriela Hernandez, an undocumented Seaburry Fellow and New Mexico Highlands University alum, features a series of 6&#8217;x3&#8217; banners that represent struggles of LGBTQ and undocumented people.&#160;Mario Romero&#160;juxtaposes topics of the occult, scientific and astronomical with the border.&#160;Pulsoans Ans, graffiti artist and ANS Art Gallery owner, commands spray paint canisters to produce pieces that play with the idea of life and death as they apply to the identities in the margins.&#160;Peter&#160;Bill, Assistant Professor of New Media at Western New Mexico University, and&#160;H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, Associate Professor of Queer &amp; Border Studies at The University of Texas at Austin, documented their projections of guerrilla video texts onto the streets of Ciudad Juarez.&#160;Sarita Corderito&#160;adds witty political commentary and tasty painting/collage chops to the mix.<br />Special presentations include H&#233;ctor Dom&#237;nguez Ruvalcaba, PhD&#8217;s reading from his work &quot;Aesthetics and Politics of the US-Mexico Border urban art,&#8221; at 7pm during Pioneer Square artwalk on May 5.

This story&#8217;s honesty and hilarity will not only touch mothers and daughters and caregivers of aging parents, but everyone who has dealt with the difficulty of growing up and watching the world change drastically around them.&#8221;<br /> <br /> Kessler-Jeffrey previously directed the extended run of Jeeves Intervenes from TTC&#39;s 2015 Season. He also directs Taproot&#39;s bullying prevention Road Company shows that tour throughout the state of Washington.<br /> <br /> The cast includes Laura Kenny (10 Things I Hate About You, Village Theatre&#39;s Mary Poppins) as the titular character Emily Linder with Helen Harvester (Taproot Theatre&#39;s Diana of Dobson&#39;s) as Janet, Charity Parenzini (Taproot Theatre&#39;s This Christmas) as Margaret and Annelih GH Hamilton (Arts West&#39;s Really, Really) as Jennifer.

In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does. The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_\">en.wikipedia.org&#8230;</a>(psychology)<br /> <br /> <br /> Flow-Artist ~<br /> <br /> Individuals who practice object manipulation with props such as a hula-hoop(s), poi, or contact-balls. They are similar to jugglers, and may even use bowling-pins and the like, except their primary goal is to achieve a meditative mental state called &quot;flow&quot; rather than just entertain but as the tools themselves become extensions of a performer&#39;s both body and energy flowing forth in this enhanced cosmic state, FLOW Artists can present a truly unique visually stunning dance performance!<br /> <br /> <br /> The 2nd annual Seattle FLOW Showcase ~<br /> <br /> Presenting an opportunity for members of Seattle&#39;s vast flow arts community &amp; family to present their talent on stage before a live audience at Re-bar.<br /> <br /> There will be 2 nearly identical performances this year as we are hoping to double our attendance and not leave anyone without a ticket or seat.. so there&#39;s an early show with doors at 7pm ending at 9:30pm at which point doors will open for the late show. Since that&#39;s an awful lot of tickets to fill the advanced admission price has been dropped to $10 but will go up closer to the event date and be $15 at the door.

Retired college professor Emily Linder summons her daughters to share her recent realization: she knows the precise time of her death. In this quirky comedic drama one eccentric family will amuse and surprise you with their preoccupations, recognitions and realizations.<br /> <br /> Director Nathan Kessler-Jeffrey said, &#8220;Richard Strand [the playwright] captures a family dealing with the new challenges of an aging parent and the old rivalries of competitive siblings.

For example, wolf re-introduction in Yellowstone has increased willow tree growth by controlling herbivorous elk. Plants benefit indirectly. Plant pollinators can also be affected by predators, benefiting plant reproduction and survival. Ecological relationships between plants and animals can be complex.
